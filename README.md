# 🤖 I Built an Excel Chatbot with AI — No Code, Just Prompts
> **Prompt + Local LLM + Streamlit = A Personal Excel Chatbot**

Hey there! 👋

This little project started with a question:
“Can I build a chatbot that understands Excel files… without writing a single line of code?”

Turns out — yes, totally possible!
Thanks to some amazing AI tools, models, and a whole lot of experimenting, I built a working Excel chatbot just by talking to ChatGPT and using open-source models like Mistral-7B from Hugging Face.

## 💡 What’s This All About?

The goal was simple:

👉 Create a chatbot that can answer questions about Excel sheets — like total sales, best-selling products, monthly revenue, etc.

But here’s the twist…

I didn’t write any code myself — I just explained what I wanted to ChatGPT, asked the right questions, iterated a bit, and boom 💥 the bot was ready.

It connects to a local LLM, reads Excel files, and responds to your questions with real insights.

🧪 What I Tried First

I tested tools like:

🟡 Claude — great, but not as flexible

⚪ ChatGPT — ended up giving me more accurate and helpful answers

After a few tests, I decided to go all-in on ChatGPT to guide and generate everything for this project.

## 🔨 What’s Under the Hood?

The backend uses:

Streamlit – for the simple web interface

Pandas – for reading Excel files

GPT4All + Mistral-7B model – for offline chatbot brainpower

No code written manually – everything came from prompts

## 🤯 Why This is Exciting

This project made me realize something powerful:

Building custom bots and agents is no longer just for developers.

If you can explain what you want clearly, AI can build it for you.
I went from idea ➝ execution using only natural language. That’s the future.

And with platforms like Hugging Face, you can run smart models locally, no internet or APIs needed.

## 👀 But Wait… It’s Not Perfect

Of course, there are limitations:

The model can be slow sometimes

Some questions don’t get answered properly

It still needs your brain to guide it

But I genuinely believe this is just the beginning.
The next generation of GenAI tools will make things even easier, faster, and more human-like.

## 🌟 Final Thought

I built a chatbot…

Just by talking to another chatbot.

Kinda meta. Kinda cool.
And definitely the future. 🧠✨
